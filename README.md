# leetcode-grind
My personal LeetCode grind, starting from now

Every problem solved will present a top comment with the following pattern: <br>
<code>
  Author: {Who designed the solution} <br>
  Time: {Big-O notation for time complexity} <br>
  Space: {Big-O notation for space complexity} <br>
  Score: {% faster than on LeetCode} , {% memory usage less than on LeetCode} <br>
  N.B. {optional notes about the algorithm} <br>
</code>
