# leetcode-grind
My personal LeetCode grind, starting from now

Every problem solved will present a top comment with the following pattern:

# Author: {Who designed the solution}
# Time: {Big-O notation for time complexity}
# Space: {Big-O notation for space complexity}
# Score: {% faster than on LeetCode} , {% memory usage less than on LeetCode}
# N.B. {optional notes about the algorithm}
